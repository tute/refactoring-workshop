    OHAI GOOD MORNING WELCOME!
    <br>
    <br>
    Now please turn to the person at your side and ask them:
    <ol>
      <li>Their name
      <li>Are they new to programming?
      <li>for how long have they been programming in Ruby?
      <li>And of course say a friendly "good morning", the first one of this
      amazing RailsConf!

    You have 2 minutes!

    In this workshop we'll learn to transform this...
    <br>
    <br>
    You can see some weird coding standards, with dollar signs before
    variables and a weird OO syntax.
    <br>
    <br>
    (troll face) Kidding! Just PHP!
    <br>
    <br>
    Let's put here whatever code you have in mind of any project you have been
    working on and not like/just don't know how to deal with.
    <br>
    <br>
    MY GOAL for this workshop is that you learn tools you need to improve
    your existing code bases.
    <br>
    <br>
    MY GOAL is that you leave with a set of well defined
    steps for you to improve your own tools, to work better from today on.
    <br>
    <br>
    So, check it out, because from this PHP we'll go all the way through...

  <aside class="notes">
    I need to learn a little about you, to see how to spend this precious

    Do you have Ruby and git installed in your computers? Please raise

    Definitions: Refactoring Patterns
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Refactoring</strong> is the process of restructuring existing code
    without changing its external behavior. Advantages are improved code
    readability, reduced complexity, improve source code maintainability, and
    create a more expressive architecture or object model.
    <br>
    <br>
    A <strong>pattern</strong> is a general reusable solution to a
    reccurring problem.  It is a description or template for how to solve a
    problem that can be used in many different situations. Patterns are
    formalized best practices

  <h2>Refactoring Patterns</h2>

      <span style="color:blue">1. Intention Revealing Method</span>
    <p>
      <span style="color:blue">2. Special Case Object</span>
    <p>
      <span style="color:blue">3. Replace Method with Method Object</span>
    <p>
      <span style="color:blue">4. Service Object</span>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Name each, and ask: If any of you are familiar with it, would you
      introduce the general idea? N heads are better than 1, I'd like to hear
      different definitions.
    <li>1. Turns comments unnecessary, as code reads better
    <li>2. Avoids type checks/conditionals. Just tell the object what to do.
    <li>3. Refactor "gigantic" methods at ease, takes care of state.
      Big methods come with big classess full of temporary variables.
    <li>4. Extract responsibilities from BIG god objects.

  <h3>Intention Revealing Method</h3>

  <p><span style="color:green">Why</span> it's called is more important than</p>
  <p><span style="color:blue">how/what</span> it does.</p>

<pre style="margin:1em auto"><code data-trim contenteditable>
# Remove duplicates?
if hash[row[1]][date] != row[0]
  # ...
</code></pre>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
if remove_duplicates?(row, date)
  # ...

def remove_duplicates?(data, date)
</code></pre>


  <aside class="notes">
    <li>Idea: Extract relevant concepts into methods with "proper" names.
    <li>Comments not needed any longer. Edit in place?
    <li>Keep all of the operations in a method at the same LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION.
    <li>Comments are fragile: we edit code which is what runs and gets tested,
    and may forget to update the comments. "Lies waiting to happen".
    <li>Code now reads itself, which is the most beautiful thing we can
    achieve. The Ruby language takes pride on this: it does what you think it
    does.
    <li>Code grows with more characters, lines, but also
    <strong>readability</strong>. Though arguably it's actually shorter to
    read, cause we don't really need to see how do we compute if there's a
    duplicate (implementation detail, low-level detail).

<section data-transition="none">
  <h3>Intention Revealing Method</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Add <span style="color:blue">comments</span> if code needs it

      <br>
      <small>Transform them syntactically, then create the method.</small>
    <li>Comments are now <span style="color:green">code</span>.<br>
